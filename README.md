# PerceptionChallenge

Methodology: I first began researching how to do this on youtube and what platforms to complete the challenge on and eventually landed on Jupyter labs. Based on my research, my plan was to convert the image to hsv and then used color bounds to isolate the cones. Then I took the new image and used contour detection to figure out the location of each cone. Then, using the coordinates of the cones, I drew best fit lines to match it. This however did not work as the program drew a horizontal line due to being split by the two lines of cones. To fix this, I split the image into two vertical halves, ran the same method separately on each one and then combined them again. This time however, the right side was perfect but the left side was a vertical line and I realized it was due to the reddish door on the left side of the image. So I then made the color bounds narrower so that the program would only pay attention to the cones and it worked.
